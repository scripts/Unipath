----------------------------------
* Delete spurious references to deleted ``unipath.platform`` package.

---------------------------
* Rename Path to AbstractPath, and FSPath to Path.  FSPath remains as an
  alias for backward compatibility.
* Allow integers in constructor.
* Path.mkdir() checks whether the directory exists first.
* Test suite now uses nose instead of unittest.
* "+" operator returns concatenated path rather than string.
* Bugfix in Path.rel_path_to().
* Thanks to Roman <mereandor@gmail.com> for patches and suggestions.
* Delete Path.symlink(); use Path.write_link() instead -- note that the 
  arg is the desination rather than the source!
* Path.make_relative_link_to() is a shortcut for
  ``self.write_link(self.rel_path_to(dst))``.
* Delete the ``platform`` package.  See the tests if you need non-native
  path syntax.`
